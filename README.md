# UNESCO World Heritage Sites Info System 🏛️

**My first ever Python project from Class 11! 🚀**

This repository represents the start of my coding journey. It is the very first project I built when I was learning the fundamentals of Python, logic building, and exploring data management concepts (which later introduced me to libraries like Pandas).

## 📖 About the Project

This is a menu-driven application developed as a Computer Science project. It acts as an information hub for various UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India, allowing users to view historical details and perform list operations like sorting, deleting, and modifying entries.

## 📋 Features

* **Detailed Information:** View historical facts about 8 major sites including the Taj Mahal, Sun Temple, and Ellora Caves.
* **Sorting:** Functionality to sort the list of sites in ascending or descending order.
* **List Management (CRUD):**
    * Delete sites by their list position.
    * Delete sites by their name value.
    * Modify existing list elements.
* **Interactive Menu:** A user-friendly loop that lets you perform multiple operations in one session.

## 🎓 What I Learned

Since this was my Class 11 project, it helped me master:
* **Python Basics:** Variables, Loops (`for`), and Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`).
* **Data Structures:** Working with Lists and indexing.
* **Data Handling:** Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which laid the foundation for learning advanced tools like **Pandas** later on.
